The dataset is taken from Kaggle. The dashboard outlines the AQI (Air Quality Index) values for ASEAN countries like Indonesia, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Philipines and Vietnam. The higher the Air Quality, the worse the air pollution in that country.

There are 4 types of Air Quality components that are use to measure air quality. They are carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, ozone and particle matter. 

As we can see from the chart, Indonesia has the worst Air Quality.
